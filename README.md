# Solar Power Bank Calculator

A web-based application that helps you estimate the solar charging potential for your power bank based on sunlight exposure, temperature, and device power consumption. It also displays the charging efficiency over time with a dynamic graph.

## Features

- **Solar Charging Estimator**: 
  - Calculate the efficiency of solar charging based on sunlight hours, temperature, and device power consumption (mAh/hour).
  - View the charge gained and the estimated battery life.
  
- **Battery Status Indicator**: 
  - A dynamic progress bar showing the current charging status.

- **Efficiency Over Time Graph**: 
  - A graph displaying the efficiency of solar charging at different temperatures, with real-time updates.

- **Dark Mode Toggle**: 
  - Toggle between light and dark modes for a better viewing experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling the page.
- **JavaScript**: 
  - Handles the logic for calculating charging efficiency, updating battery status, and generating the efficiency graph.
  - Uses the `Chart.js` library for visualizing the efficiency data.
